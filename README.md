# Neural-Networks
This project implements a Multilayer Perceptron feed-forward neural network and evaluates
its performance in classifying handwritten digits. The same network is used to analyze a more
challenging hand-drawn images dataset and compares the performance of the neural network against a deep
neural network using the TensorFlow library. Varying hidden layers are used to analyze their effect on performance. Script for running the network on provided datasets is nnScript.py. See [project_overview](https://github.com/Cabbler25/Neural-Networks/blob/master/project_overview.pdf) for complete details. Credits to Varun Chandola, professor at the University at Buffalo, for provided data sets and much of the contents of the pdf.
