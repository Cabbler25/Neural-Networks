# Neural-Networks
This project implements a Multilayer Perceptron feed-forward neural network and evaluates
its performance in classifying handwritten digits. The same network is used to analyze a more
challenging hand-drawn images dataset and compares the performance of the neural network against a deep
neural network using the TensorFlow library. Varying hidden layers are used to analyze their effect on performance. Script for running the network on provided datasets is nnScript.py. See project_overview for complete details.
